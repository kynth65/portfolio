  detailedDescription: "Quill is a feature-complete web application that combines habit tracking, journaling, and AI-powered insights to help users maintain a consistent writing practice. The app provides a distraction-free writing experience with a TipTap-based rich text editor, automatic saving, and offline support. Users can track their writing streaks, monitor word count statistics, and view their writing history in a visual calendar. The app includes AI-powered sentiment analysis and mood tracking, generating weekly or monthly reflections on the user's writing journey. All data is securely stored with Row-Level Security in Supabase, with IndexedDB caching for instant access and offline capability. The app works as a Progressive Web App (PWA) and can be installed on mobile or desktop devices. Key features include comprehensive statistics dashboards, data export functionality in multiple formats (JSON, CSV, Markdown), and background synchronization when connectivity is restored.",
